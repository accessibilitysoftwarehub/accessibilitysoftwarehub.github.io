        <p class="header-text">We are a group of faculty and students at the College of Engineering of Otago Polytechnic. Over the years we have created accessibility software solutions for computer users with motor impairment. The different software applications provided in this website have been developed by Bachelor of Information Technology degree students as part of their final year capstone project. Here is a bit of info about the people who have contributed to the different software projects over time.</p>
