		<li>
			<h3>Where can I download the software?</h3>
			<br>
			<p>You can download any of our projects by following the download link on the <a href="software.html">Software</a> section of this site.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>How can this software benefit me?</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Most of the software applications in this page are geared towards users with severe motor impairment with the goal of facilitating interaction with a computer in some manner. 
			Installing the software applications will likely require the help of a caregiver or someone with no motor impairment.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Where can I get a low cost eyetracker?</h3>
			<br>
			<p> We recommend the following two options
			<br>
			<a href="http://tobiigaming.com/product/tobii-eyex/" target="_blank">Tobii EyeX</a>
			<br>
			<a href="https://tobiigaming.com/eye-tracker-4c/" target="_blank">Tobii Eye Tracker 4C</a></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>How does your software compare with commercial accessiblity software solutions?</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Our software applications are created by students who still do not have the level of expertise and skills of professional software developers.  Hence, code quality and documentation are often
			sub-optimal. The software is intended for motor impaired users with very constrained financial situations who cannot afford a high quality but expensive accessibility software solution. Our honest opinion is that if you
			can afford around NZ$3000, we would much rather recommend accessibility software and hardware from commercial companies that provide user assistance and troubleshooting such as:
			<br>
			<a href="https://www.tobiidynavox.com/en-US/software/windows-software/windows-control-2/" target="_blank">Tobii Dynavox Windows Control </a>
			<br>
			<a href="http://www.mygaze.com/products/mygaze-eye-tracker/" target="_blank"> myGaze </a>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Can you guys help me with a specific issue I have with the software?</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Sorry we can't. We simply don't have the time. We are confident that if someone goes through the user guide, most issues should be resolved. If that is not the case, 
			we recommend a commercial accessibility solution that provides customer assistance</p>
		</li>		
		<li>
		<h3>How good is the software? After all, it has been developed by students...</h3>
			<br>
			<p>This is a fair concern. We cannot guarantee anything about the software. Some students simply lack attention to detail. That being said, many students are highly competent and dedicated to the project.
			We honestly believe that some of the applications created are robust and efficient pieces of software that arguably provide many of the functionalities of very expensive commercial accessibility solutions.</p>
